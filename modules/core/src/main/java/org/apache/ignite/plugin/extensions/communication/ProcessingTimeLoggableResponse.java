 * <ol>
 *     <li>Send timestamp is written to request when request is sent.
 *          See {@link TimeLoggableRequest#sendTimestamp(long)}<li/>
 *     <li>When request is received on target node it's receive timestamp is written.
 *          See {@link TimeLoggableRequest#receiveTimestamp(long)}.
 *          Later this timestamp is passed to response message which is triggered by received request.
 *          See {@link #reqReceivedTimestamp(long)}<li/>
 *     <li>When response is send back from target node sum of request send timestamp and message process time
 *          is written to response. See {@link #reqTimeData(long)}<li/>
 *     <li>When response is received on initial node timestamp from step 3 is deducted from current time.
 *          See {@link #reqTimeData()}. This leaves time that messages spend in network.<li/>
